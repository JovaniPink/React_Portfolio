          An adventurer by heart, leader, and problem-solver by nature. Iâ€™ve
          worn many hats in my life which have given me the life lessons and
          experiences to mold me into a very adaptable and hard-working
          individual. Spending most of my working life in the hospitality
          industry, I know what is to be punctual, energizing, polite, calm, a
          multitasker, and flexible. My work in the outdoor industry has given
          me the title of teacher, leader, steward, athlete, competitor, and
          risk manager. The volunteering work I do has taught me how to be an
          influencer with integrity, an enthusiastic motivator, and an organized
          and dependable communicator. All of these traits have made my
          transition into a web developer much smoother. The daily collaboration
          is a crucial part of the experience. I can not wait to build some
          amazing things together.
